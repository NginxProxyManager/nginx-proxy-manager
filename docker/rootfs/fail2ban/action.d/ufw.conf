## Version 2022/08/06
# Fail2Ban action configuration file for ufw
#
# You are required to run "ufw enable" before this will have any effect.
#
# The insert position should be appropriate to block the required traffic.
# A number after an allow rule to the application won't be of much use.

[Definition]

actionstart = 

actionstop = 

actioncheck = 

# ufw does "quickly process packets for which we already have a connection" in before.rules,
# therefore all related sockets should be closed
# actionban is using `ss` to do so, this only handles IPv4 and IPv6.

actionban = if [ -n "<application>" ] && ufw app info "<application>"
            then
              ufw <add> <blocktype> from <ip> to <destination> app "<application>" comment "<comment>"
            else
              ufw <add> <blocktype> from <ip> to <destination> comment "<comment>"
            fi
            <kill>

actionunban = if [ -n "<application>" ] && ufw app info "<application>"
              then
                ufw delete <blocktype> from <ip> to <destination> app "<application>"
              else
                ufw delete <blocktype> from <ip> to <destination>
              fi

# Option: kill-mode
# Notes.: can be set to ss or conntrack (may be extended later with other modes) to immediately drop all connections from banned IP, default empty (no kill)
# Example: banaction = ufw[kill-mode=ss]
kill-mode =

# intern conditional parameter used to provide killing mode after ban:
_kill_ =
_kill_ss = ss -K dst "[<ip>]"
_kill_conntrack = conntrack -D -s "<ip>"

# Option: kill
# Notes.: can be used to specify custom killing feature, by default depending on option kill-mode
# Examples: banaction = ufw[kill='ss -K "( sport = :http || sport = :https )" dst "[<ip>]"']
#           banaction = ufw[kill='cutter "<ip>"']
kill = <_kill_<kill-mode>>

[Init]
# Option: add
# Notes.: can be set to "insert 1" to insert a rule at certain position (here 1):
add = prepend

# Option: blocktype
# Notes.: reject or deny
blocktype = reject

# Option: destination
# Notes.: The destination address to block in the ufw rule
destination = any

# Option: application
# Notes.: application from sudo ufw app list
application = 

# Option: comment
# Notes.: comment for rule added by fail2ban
comment = by Fail2Ban after <failures> attempts against <name>
