# Action to report IP address to ipthreat.net

#
# IMPORTANT:
#
# Reporting an IP is a serious action. Make sure that it is legit.
# Consider using this action only for:
#   * IP that has been banned more than once
#   * High max retry to avoid user mis-typing password
#   * Filters that are unlikely to be human error
#
# Example:
# ```
#   action = %(known/action)s
#            ipthreat[]
# ```
#
# The action accepts the following arguments: ipthreat[ipthreat_flags="8",ipthreat_system="SSH", ipthreat_apikey=...]
# In most cases your action could be as simple as: ipthreat[], since the default flags and system are set to the most correct default values.
# You can optionally override ipthreat_system and ipthreat_flags if desired.
# The ipthreat_apikey must be set at the bottom of this configuration file.
#
# `ipthreat_system` is a short name of the system attacked, i.e. SSH, SMTP, MYSQL, PHP, etc.
#
# For `ipthreat_flags`, most cases will use 8 (BruteForce) which is the default, but you could use others.
# You can use the name or the ordinal.
# Multiple values are comma separated.
# ```
# Name           Ordinal Description
# Dns            1       Abuse/attack of dns (domain name server)
# Fraud          2       General fraud, whether orders, misuse of payment info, etc
# DDos           4       Distributed denial of service attack, whether through http requests, large ping attack, etc
# BruteForce     8       Brute force login attack
# Proxy          16      IP is a proxy like TOR or other proxy server
# Spam           32      Email, comment or other type of spam

# Hacking        128     General hacking outside of brute force attack (includes vulnerability scans, sql injection, etc.). Use port scan flag instead if it's just probe on ports.

# Compromised    512     The ip has been taken over by malware or botnet
