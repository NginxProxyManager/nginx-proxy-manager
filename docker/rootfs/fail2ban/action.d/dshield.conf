# Fail2Ban configuration file
#
# Author: Russell Odom <russ@gloomytrousers.co.uk>
# Submits attack reports to DShield (http://www.dshield.org/)
#
# You MUST configure at least:
# <port> (the port that's being attacked - use number not name).
#
# You SHOULD also provide:
# <myip> (your public IP address, if it's not the address of eth0)
# <userid> (your DShield userID, if you have one - recommended, but reports will
# be used anonymously if not)
# <protocol> (the protocol in use - defaults to tcp)
#
# Best practice is to provide <port> and <protocol> in jail.conf like this:
# action = dshield[port=1234,protocol=tcp]
#
# ...and create "dshield.local" with contents something like this:
# [Init]
# myip = 10.0.0.1
# userid = 12345
#
# Other useful configuration values are <mailargs> (you can use for specifying
# a different sender address for the report e-mails, which should match what is
# configured at DShield), and <lines>/<minreportinterval>/<maxbufferage> (to
# configure how often the buffer is flushed).
