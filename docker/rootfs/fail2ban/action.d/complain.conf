## Version 2022/08/06
# Fail2Ban configuration file
#
# Author: Russell Odom <russ@gloomytrousers.co.uk>, Daniel Black
# Sends a complaint e-mail to addresses listed in the whois record for an
# offending IP address.
# This uses the https://abusix.com/contactdb.html to lookup abuse contacts.
#
# DEPENDENCIES:
# This requires the dig command from bind-utils
#
# You should provide the <logpath> in the jail config - lines from the log
# matching the given IP address will be provided in the complaint as evidence.
#
# WARNING
# -------
#
# Please do not use this action unless you are certain that fail2ban
# does not result in "false positives" for your deployment.  False
# positive reports could serve a mis-favor to the original cause by
# flooding corresponding contact addresses, and complicating the work
# of administration personnel responsible for handling (verified) legit
# complains.
#
# Please consider using e.g. sendmail-whois-lines.conf action which
# would send the reports with relevant information to you, so the
# report could be first reviewed and then forwarded to a corresponding
# contact if legit.
