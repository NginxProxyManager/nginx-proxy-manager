## What is an Access List?

Access Lists provide a blacklist or whitelist of specific client IP addresses along with authentication for the Proxy Hosts via Basic HTTP Authentication.

You can configure multiple client rules, usernames and passwords for a single Access List and then apply that to one or more _Proxy Hosts_.

This is most useful for forwarded web services that do not have authentication mechanisms built in or when you want to protect from unknown clients.
