## Version 2022/08/06
# Fail2Ban filters for qmail RBL patches/fake proxies
#
# the default djb RBL implementation doesn't log any rejections 
# so is useless with this filter.
#
# One patch is here:
#
# http://www.tjsi.com/rblsmtpd/faq/ patch to rblsmtpd

# DEV Notes:
#
# These seem to be for two or 3 different patches to qmail or rblsmtpd
# so you'll probably only ever see one of these regex's that match.
