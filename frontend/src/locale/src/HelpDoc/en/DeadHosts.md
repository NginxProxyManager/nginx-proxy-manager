## What is a 404 Host?

A 404 Host is simply a host setup that shows a 404 page.

This can be useful when your domain is listed in search engines and you want
to provide a nicer error page or specifically to tell the search indexers that
the domain pages no longer exist.

Another benefit of having this host is to track the logs for hits to it and
view the referrers.
